# rl_sandbox
This repo contains implementations of several **reinforcement learning** algorithms. They are implemented within either:
- `gridworld`: a custom gridworld implementation built within the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) framework.
  - Q-Learning
  - Monte Carlo Learning
  - Approximate Dynamic Programming
  - Exact Dynamic Programming
- [`dm_control`](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control): physics-based simulations for continuous control tasks.
  - [DQN](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236)
  - [Double DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)
